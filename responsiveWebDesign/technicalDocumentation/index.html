      <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
        efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach
        to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
        together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
        scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
      </p>
      <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
        available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python
        Web site, <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>,
        and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions
        of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools,
        and additional documentation.
      </p>
      <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data
        types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C).
        Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
      </p>
      <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
        and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python
        interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained,
        so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
      </p>
      <p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python
        Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal
        definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read
        Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference
        Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.
      </p>
      <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every
        single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it
        introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give
        you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it,
        you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you
         will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules
         described in The Python Standard Library.

      <header class="section-title">Whetting Your Appetite</header>
      <p>If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some
        task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a
        search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and
        rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d
        like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application,
        or a simple game.
      </p>
      <p>If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with
        several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile
        cycle is too slow. Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library
        and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written
        a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to
        design and implement a whole new language for your application.
      </p>
      <p>Python is just the language for you.</p>
      <p>You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of
        these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing
        text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. You could write
        a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get
        even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows,
        Mac OS X, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done
        more quickly.
      </p>
      <p>Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering
        much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or
        batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more
        error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has
        high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries.
        Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much
        larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least
        as easy in Python as in those languages.
      </p>
      <p>Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused
        in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard
        modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples
        to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide
        things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to
        graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.
      </p>
      <p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable
        time during program development because no compilation and linking is
        necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it
        easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away
        programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development.
        It is also a handy desk calculator.
      </p>
      <p>Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably.
        Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent
        C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;</li>
        <li>statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;</li>
        <li>no variable or argument declarations are necessary.</li>
        <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit;</Li>
        <li>Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add
         a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform
         critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to
         libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific
         graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python
         interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension
         or command language for that application.
       </p>
       <p>By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s
         Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references
         to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!
       </p>
       <p>Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it
         in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use
         it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.
       </p>
       <p>In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained.
         This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples
         shown later.
       </p>
       <p>The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python
         language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions,
         statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally
         touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

    <section id="Using_the_Python_Interpreter" class="main-section">
      <header class="section-title">Using the Python Interpreter</header>
      <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.7</code>
        on those machines where it is available; putting <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your
        Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:
      </p>
      <pre>
        python3.7
      </pre>
      <p>to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter
        lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with
        your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., <code>/usr/local/python</code>
        is a popular alternative location.)
      </p>
      <p>On Windows machines, the Python installation is usually placed in
        <code>C:\Python37</code>, though you can change this when you’re running
        the installer. To add this directory to your path, you can type the
        following command into the command prompt in a DOS box:
      </p>
      <pre>
        set path=%path%;C:\python37
      </pre>
      <p>Typing an end-of-file character (<code>Control-D</code> on Unix, <code>Control-Z</code>
        on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with
        a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter
        by typing the following command: <code>quit()</code>.
      </p>
      <p>The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing,
        history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline.
        Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is
        supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get.
        If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive
        Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys.
        If nothing appears to happen, or if <code>^P</code> is echoed, command line editing
        isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters
        from the current line.
      </p>
      <p>The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with
        standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands
        interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as
        standard input, it reads and executes a <i>script</i> from that file.
      </p>
      <p>A second way of starting the interpreter is <code>python -c command [arg] ...</code>,
        which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option.
        Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are
        special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety
        with single quotes.
      </p>
      <p>Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked
        using <code>python -m module [arg] ...</code>, which executes the source file for #
        module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.
      </p>
      <p>When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run
        the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by
        passing -i before the script.
      </p>
      <p>All command line options are described in Command line and environment.</p>
      <p>When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments
        thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the <code>argv</code>
        variable in the <code>sys</code> module. You can access this list by executing
        <code>import sys</code>. The length of the list is at least one; when no
        script and no arguments are given, <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is an empty string.
         When the script name is given as <code>'-'</code> (meaning standard input),
         <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to <code>'-'</code>. When <code>-c</code> command is used,
         <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to <code>'-c'</code>. When <code>-m</code> module is
         used, <code>sys.argv[0]</code> is set to the full name of the located module.
         Options found after <code>-c</code> command or <code>-m</code> module
         are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing
         but left in <code>sys.argv</code> for the command or module to handle.
      </p>
      <p>When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in
        interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with
        the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (<code>>>></code>); for
        continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default
        three dots (<code>...</code>). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating
        its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first
        prompt:
      </p>
      <pre>
        $ python3.7
        Python 3.7 (default, Sep 16 2015, 09:25:04)
        [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

      <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the
        presence or absence of prompts (>>> and …): to repeat the example, you
        must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines
        that do not begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note
        that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an example means you must
        type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.
      </p>
      <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the
        interactive prompt, include comments. Comments in Python start with the
        hash character, #, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment
        may appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but
        not within a string literal. A hash character within a string literal
        is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not
        interpreted by Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.
